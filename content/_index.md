      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text:  I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI). With a strong passion for advancing AI technologies, I am focusing on applying cutting-edge methodologies in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision to solve real-world challenges.

Prior to my masterâ€™s journey, I accumulated four years of professional experience as a Data Scientist. During this time, I had the opportunity to lead and contribute to impactful projects, including the development of an NLP model tailored for [specific purpose, if applicable, e.g., sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, or document processing]. My work involved leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms, fine-tuning pre-trained language models, and implementing scalable solutions to drive business insights and automation.


        I apply a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to comprehensively investigate the role of science and technology in the economy.
