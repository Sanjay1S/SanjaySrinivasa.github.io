## Work Experience

**UnitedHealth Group - Optum Applied Research Group (_July 2020 - August 2024_)**

**_Associate AI/ML Engineer_**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
- Engineered a stacked ensemble model combining random forests, gradient boosting, and logistic regres
sion to prioritize patient collections, increasing hospital collection rates by 70%.
- Implemented a multi-stage NLP pipeline using GPT 3.5, Vicuna, and DistilBERT, enhancing call center
 performance, reducing repeat calls, and boosting Net Promoter Score by 82%.
- Researched and fine-tuned Microsoft’s small language model (SLM) Phi-2 (2.7B) for question-answering
 tasks on clinical reports, achieving minimal precision loss compared to larger LLMs.
- Applied linear and per-channel quantization on VGG (Visual Geometry Group) CNN model with just
 <0.2% accuracy loss, enabling faster processing of medical claim images to accelerate insurance approvals and
 reduce delays.
- Developed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with semantic chunking to assist call agents in
 answering provider and patient queries, reducing LLM hallucination and improving response accuracy by 15%.

 **_Data Scientist_**
- Collaborated with Google to evaluate generative AI LLMs on Zero-Shot and Few-Shot learning using their
 Cloud Vertex AI platform.
- Designed a Python-PySpark pipeline on Databricks, achieving 98.6% precision in PHI/PII de-identification.
 using SparkNLP models like ClinicalNER and De-identification NER.
- Established a system to identify patterns in patient insurance claims, using the unsupervised clustering algorithm
 DBSCAN, achieving 98.5% precision and improving processing efficiency.

 **_Software Engineer_**
- Developed a YOLOv5-based OCR system to extract patient vitals from PDFs, increasing extraction accuracy
 by 15% using OpenCV and TensorFlow.
- Automatedaudio-to-text transcription with Microsoft’s Azure ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), stream
lining deployment with Jenkins and Docker
